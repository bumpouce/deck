              create a similar effect with some simple rectangles. A good

              I'm back from the museums and back to reading MDN documentation.
              This is a fairly simple idea that I think get a lot of benefit
              from good color choices. The most advanced thing we're doing is
              using gradients to turn our rectangles into star trails. Use the

              The exhibition was so striking that I couldn't just choose one
              piece. In the SUW/UW Series, Hilma was very interested in
              reflections, duality and other symbols. We've replicated that in
              code by drawing our own equalaterial triangles and using overlay
              blending modes to save some lines of code.

              I finally got to visit the Hilma af Klint exhibit at the
              Guggenheim, and loved her later geometric work. My reproduction
              isn't nearly as hypnotizing to look at, but a simple and fun
              exercise.

              Like the stripes they're named after, this card has a sort of
              slippery, hypnotic effect. Drawing the line groups on a grid is a
              little tricky, and I feel like I could have done it smoother. Use

              gradients. The results are some very pretty stepping stones, which
              I thought looked best in a circle.

              A jump in complexity here. This sketch utilizes a lot of nested
              loops to iterate deep into some squares. Whenever we draw a
              square, we make a decision to subdivide it and draw more, and
              again a second time. This way we get a drill-down, spiraling sort
              of look. Use the Update Preview button to draw a new card!

              kind of a cool effect when you can stack them together to make
              these wavy lines. Changing the step value will show more of the
              original idea.

            <h2>Varsarely</h2>
            <p>
              Victor Vasarely was a Hungarian-French artist frequently credited
              as the grandfather of Op Art, an abstract style that gives the
              viewer impressions of movement, hidden images, warping, vibrating
              patterns and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our code is little more complex here, we've created a function
              that will return an array to us, each item is an object
              coordinates and a boolean value for rotation. We use this
              information to move our origin point to where we need to draw each
              square. This makes it easier to rotate our chosen squares since
              canvas rotations happen from the origin point.
