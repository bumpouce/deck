            <h2>Datamosh</h2>
            <p>
              Datamosh is by far the most complicated card we've put together,
              fully implementing some pixel sorting functions. Pixel sorting is
              an effect created by rearranging pixels in columns or rows based
              on some criteria like brightness or amount of a color.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're reading all the image data into a giant array where every
              four values represents a pixels R,G,B and alpha values. From there
              we add them all up and compare to a neighbor to see if it meets a
              threshold. When this effect is magnified across the entire canvas
              we get these great lines of sorted pixels.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can change the threshold, strength, number of loops and image
              in the first function to create your own outputs. Have fun!

              Sometimes it's a very simple piece of math that sparks an idea and
              this week it was just the very simple equations for finding a
              point on a circle. What happens if you find more than one point?
              What happens if you find points on just a section of a circle? All
              of these questions stack up to make a neat little image. You can

              Last night was the third Plotter People NYC meetup, and I got a
              short explainer on modern spirographs from
              <a href="https://twitter.com/ox/" target="_blank">Artem</a>. I
              remember them from the little plastic gears in my grandparent's
              house and it turns out they're still fun in the digital world. I
              love the tiny variants, I thought it looked like a little coral
              reef or collection of germs. You can play with the radius of the
              circle and ratio to make your own graphs.

              I was able to learn about the

                target="_blank"
                >Sierpiński curve</a
              >. It's wonderful! It's a space filling curve, which I understand
              to mean that it can calculate how to fill a space no matter how
              many times you subdivide it. This leads to some beautiful
              patterns, which I've stacked on top of each other here. You can
              play with the iteration depth of the main function to see
              different patterns.

              This isn't the most complex card, but I couldn't help but take
              advantage of the Halloween spirit. We are using strokes on boxes
              as a easy way to get curved corners, much cheaper than having to
              calculate arcs ourselves.

              One of the most fun things to do with this project is create a
              sort of illusion of complexity. Why make a real sorting algorithm
              when you can just add random numbers? I think this is a pretty fun
              effect and we get to use some older methods for gradient styles.

              We're doing some technically more difficult stuff than is
              neccesary here, but it allows us some fun experimentation with
              changing the widths and gradient colors of the bands. Try it

              If you wrap the golden ratio around a circle, the angle of the
              smaller section is called the golden angle. It's about 137° and
              turns out it's very cool. It's often studied in plants and the
              theory of phyllotaxis, that leaves segment themselves according to
              this angle. Here we're using the golden angle and some clever

              I finally got to visit the Hilma af Klint exhibit at the

              A jump in complexity here. This sketch utilizes a lot of nested
              loops to iterate deep into some squares. Whenever we draw a
              square, we make a decision to subdivide it and draw more, and
              again a second time. This way we get a drill-down, spiraling sort

            <h2>Varsarely</h2>
            <p>
              Victor Vasarely was a Hungarian-French artist frequently credited
              as the grandfather of Op Art, an abstract style that gives the
              viewer impressions of movement, hidden images, warping, vibrating
              patterns and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our code is little more complex here, we've created a function
              that will return an array to us, each item is an object
              coordinates and a boolean value for rotation. We use this
              information to move our origin point to where we need to draw each
              square. This makes it easier to rotate our chosen squares since
              canvas rotations happen from the origin point.
