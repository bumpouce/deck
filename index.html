            <p>
              I finally got to visit the Hilma af Klint exhibit at the
              Guggenheim, and loved her later geometric work. My reproduction
              isn't nearly as hypnotizing to look at, but a simple and fun
              exercise.

              In the spirit of old Windows screensavers and circuit boards, lets
              draw some lines. Using some tricky double strokes, we can create
              an overlapping, but never touching effect. Use the Update Preview

              Like the stripes they're named after, this card has a sort of
              slippery, hypnotic effect. Drawing the line groups on a grid is a
              little tricky, and I feel like I could have done it smoother. Use

              Math is kinda hard, and so are string literals. I wanted to
              experiment with mathematically creating colors and color
              gradients. The results are some very pretty stepping stones, which
              I thought looked best in a circle.

              I wanted to experiment with clipping masks in canvas, and it ended
              up looking like really big pixels. Reminiscent of leaning in to an
              old iMac, I decided to lean in to the RGB aesthetic. Use the

              A jump in complexity here. This sketch utilizes a lot of nested
              loops to iterate deep into some squares. Whenever we draw a
              square, we make a decision to subdivide it and draw more, and
              again a second time. This way we get a drill-down, spiraling sort
              of look. Use the Update Preview button to draw a new card!

              No cool story here, just some fun shapes. The interesting stuff
              we're doing here is probably the helper functions that pick a
              random item from an array and pick a random whole number from a
              range. We'll be using these a lot in later cards I imagine. Use

              our sphere and create the halo effect.

              Charlie Brown confirmed wavy. This one started out a little
              different, without overlapping the half circle shapes. But it's
              kind of a cool effect when you can stack them together to make
              these wavy lines. Changing the step value will show more of the
              original idea.

              I saw some branding recently that used these covers overlaid to

              shapes here for something more abstract. We do manually place each
              trapezoid and it has a rigid width, so lots of room for
              improvement here.

              rectangle in the center, increasing it's size, rotation and
              distance to the next rectangle with each step.

            <h2>Varsarely</h2>
            <p>
              Victor Vasarely was a Hungarian-French artist frequently credited
              as the grandfather of Op Art, an abstract style that gives the
              viewer impressions of movement, hidden images, warping, vibrating
              patterns and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our code is little more complex here, we've created a function
              that will return an array to us, each item is an object
              coordinates and a boolean value for rotation. We use this
              information to move our origin point to where we need to draw each
              square. This makes it easier to rotate our chosen squares since
              canvas rotations happen from the origin point.
