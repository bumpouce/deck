            Canvas Cards is a gallery of card designs created with javasript
            canvas. Updated every Friday, each card includes an editable code
            block, feel free to tweak your own designs! Created by
            <a href="http://friendofpixels.com/" target="_blank">Luke Patton</a>

              I wanted to experiment with clipping masks in canvas, and it ended
              up looking like really big pixels. Reminiscent of leaning in to an
              old iMac, I decided to lean in to the RGB aesthetic. Click the

              A jump in complexity here. This sketch utilizes a lot of nested
              loops to iterate deep into some squares. Whenever we draw a
              square, we make a decision to subdivide it and draw more, and
              again a second time. This way we get a drill-down, spiraling sort
              of look. Click the card for a new drawing!

              No cool story here, just some fun shapes. The interesting stuff
              we're doing here is probably the helper functions that pick a
              random item from an array and pick a random whole number from a
              range. We'll be using these a lot in later cards I imagine. Click

              Science is the new Rock and Roll. Inspired by a screenshot of the
              Nowhere Men comic that a coworker had lying around. The only
              tricky thing here is drawing half an ellipse to cover the front of
              our sphere and create the halo effect.

            <p>
              Charlie Brown confirmed wavy. This one started out a little
              different, without overlapping the half circle shapes. But it's
              kind of a cool effect when you can stack them together to make
              these wavy lines. Changing the step value will show more of the
              original idea.

            <h2>Special K</h2>
            <p>
              I saw some branding recently that used these covers overlaid to
              make the letter K. It was pretty cool so I adapted some of the
              shapes here for something more abstract. We do manually place each
              trapezoid and it has a rigid width, so lots of room for
              improvement here.

              I named this one Vertigo before going and looking at the poster
              again, but I like the rectangle theme. Start with a small
              rectangle in the center, increasing it's size, rotation and
              distance to the next rectangle with each step.

            <h2>Varsarely</h2>
            <p>
              Victor Vasarely was a Hungarian-French artist frequently credited
              as the grandfather of Op Art, an abstract style that gives the
              viewer impressions of movement, hidden images, warping, vibrating
              patterns and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our code is little more complex here, we've created a function
              that will return an array to us, each item is an object
              coordinates and a boolean value for rotation. We use this
              information to move our origin point to where we need to draw each
              square. This makes it easier to rotate our chosen squares since
              canvas rotations happen from the origin point.
