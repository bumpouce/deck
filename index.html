              If you wrap the golden ratio around a circle, the angle of the
              smaller section is called the golden angle. It's about 137Â° and
              turns out it's very cool. It's often studied in plants and the
              theory of phyllotaxis, that leaves segment themselves according to
              this angle. Here we're using the golden angle and some clever
              colors to create a perfect spiral.

              I was sick this week so we're reaching into the drafts folder a
              bit for a simple excercise that has some pleasing results. Linear
              interpolation allows us to make a perfect grid relateively easily
              and cycle through it with random colors. Use the Update Preview

              One of the most confusing parts of canvas I've learned so far is
              the global composite operation. It's like blending modes in
              photoshop, and there's a ton of nuanced ways to use them. Here
              we're punching circular holes in a grey rectangle to reveal a
              gradient behind it. Also featuring linear interpolation for
              positioning our circles.

              Welcome to summer everyone! I feel like I know almost nothing
              about canvas filters, but they seem quite powerful and are gaining
              support rapidly. Here we're just stacking slightly blurrier and
              more transparent circles to create our effect.

              More fun with hexagons this week. I really like how there seem to
              be some organic peaks and valleys in the opacity, but I promise
              it's just random. Also some fun nudging to get our hexagons to

              Did you know that the interior angles of any given polygon add up
              to <code>180 * (n-2)</code> where n is the number of sides? That's
              something that I learned this week when thinking about hexagons.

              This is a fairly simple idea that I think get a lot of benefit

              The exhibition was so striking that I couldn't just choose one
              piece. In the SUW/UW Series, Hilma was very interested in
              reflections, duality and other symbols. We've replicated that in
              code by drawing our own equalaterial triangles and using overlay
              blending modes to save some lines of code.

              A jump in complexity here. This sketch utilizes a lot of nested
              loops to iterate deep into some squares. Whenever we draw a
              square, we make a decision to subdivide it and draw more, and
              again a second time. This way we get a drill-down, spiraling sort

              No cool story here, just some fun shapes. The interesting stuff
              we're doing here is probably the helper functions that pick a
              random item from an array and pick a random whole number from a
              range. We'll be using these a lot in later cards I imagine. Use
              the Update Preview button to draw a new card!

              Science is the new Rock and Roll. Inspired by a screenshot of the
              Nowhere Men comic that a coworker had lying around. The only
              tricky thing here is drawing half an ellipse to cover the front of
              our sphere and create the halo effect.

              Charlie Brown confirmed wavy. This one started out a little
              different, without overlapping the half circle shapes. But it's
              kind of a cool effect when you can stack them together to make
              these wavy lines. Changing the step value will show more of the
              original idea.

            <h2>Special K</h2>
            <p>
              I saw some branding recently that used these covers overlaid to
              make the letter K. It was pretty cool so I adapted some of the
              shapes here for something more abstract. We do manually place each
              trapezoid and it has a rigid width, so lots of room for
              improvement here.

              I named this one Vertigo before going and looking at the poster
              again, but I like the rectangle theme. Start with a small
              rectangle in the center, increasing it's size, rotation and
              distance to the next rectangle with each step.

            <h2>Varsarely</h2>
            <p>
              Victor Vasarely was a Hungarian-French artist frequently credited
              as the grandfather of Op Art, an abstract style that gives the
              viewer impressions of movement, hidden images, warping, vibrating
              patterns and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our code is little more complex here, we've created a function
              that will return an array to us, each item is an object
              coordinates and a boolean value for rotation. We use this
              information to move our origin point to where we need to draw each
              square. This makes it easier to rotate our chosen squares since
              canvas rotations happen from the origin point.
